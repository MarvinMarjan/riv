***Riv*** have four built-in data types:

- [Null](#null)
- [String](#string)
- [Number](#number)
- [Bool](#bool)
- [Array](#array)
- [Function](#function)




## Null

*Null* is a data type that represents the value `null`.


## String

*String* is a data type that represents a text value. *Strings* are enclosed by `"..."` or `'...'`:

- `"Hello, world!"`

## Bool

*Bool* is a data type that represents two conditional values: `true` and `false`
