A non-assignable type is a type that can't be referenced as its own, they only can be used in conjunction with other specific expressions or statements. For example, a [Package](/doc/language/features/packages.md) is a non-assignable data type. You can't pass it to functions, assign it to a variable or use it with arithmetic expression as an operand. The only way to evaluate a package type is using the specific and unique [Package Resolution Expression](/doc/language/syntax/expressions.md#package-resolution).
