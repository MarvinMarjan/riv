**Syntatic Sugar** is a term used to refer a syntax that expands to another one. For example, the [Loop Statement](/doc/language/syntax/statements.md#loop-statement) expands to `while (true) ...`. That means the loop statement does not have a real behaviour, it just references another existing one, but with a cleaner syntax that allows the programmer *write less* and get the same result as using the raw `while (true) ...`
