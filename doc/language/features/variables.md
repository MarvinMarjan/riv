A **Variable** is used to store a value and reuse it later in code. You can create a variable with the [Var Statement](/doc/language/syntax/statements.md#var-statement).

```
var number = 50;

print number;
```

Variables also can be modified after their declaration (creation):

```
number = 25;
```

Note that the value to initialize a variable is optional. If no value is specified, the variable will have the value [null](/doc/language/syntax/types.md#null) by default.
