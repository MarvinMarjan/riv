***Riv*** is a interpreted functional dynamic typed programming language that focus on code readability.

You can see what the language currently can do in the [Documentation](/doc).

## Building

Pre-requisites:
- **g++** compiler with support for C++20
- **Make** building system

``` shell
git clone "https://github.com/MarvinMarjan/riv.git"

If you need to access it from some other place, you can create a shortcut or add the binary path to the 
`PATH` environment variable.***
